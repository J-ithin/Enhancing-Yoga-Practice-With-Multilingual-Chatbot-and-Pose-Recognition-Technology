### Abstract

Yoga is a widely practiced discipline that promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The emergence of computer vision and artificial intelligence has enabled advancements in pose detection, offering a valuable tool for yoga practitioners to improve their postures. This project explores a system capable of analyzing yoga poses in real-time using MediaPipe and OpenCV. By extracting joint angles and comparing them to a dataset of predefined yoga poses, the system provides corrective feedback to help users refine their practice. The application is particularly valuable for remote yoga sessions, where real-time feedback is not readily available from an instructor.

### Methodology

The methodology involves the following steps:

#### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - **Image Dataset:** A collection of yoga poses in image format was curated. The dataset includes images labeled with the name of the pose and the corresponding average joint angle values.
   - **Preprocessing:** Images were normalized and resized to ensure consistent input dimensions. Landmarks from the images were extracted using MediaPipe’s pose detection API.

#### 2. **Angle Calculation:**
   - Landmarks detected by MediaPipe were utilized to calculate joint angles using trigonometric functions.
   - The formula for angle calculation between three points was applied, ensuring accuracy for both acute and obtuse angles.

#### 3. **Pose Detection:**
   - A CSV file was generated containing joint angle data and corresponding pose names.
   - For real-time input, angles from live video frames were calculated and matched against the average angles in the dataset using a similarity measure.

#### 4. **Feedback Mechanism:**
   - The system compared the user’s pose angles to predefined averages.
   - Discrepancies were highlighted, and corrections were suggested to minimize the angular differences.
   - A user-friendly interface displayed the detected pose and detailed feedback for improvement.

#### 5. **Implementation Tools:**
   - **Libraries:** OpenCV for video processing, MediaPipe for pose detection, and NumPy for numerical computations.
   - **Programming Language:** Python.
   - **Visualization:** Feedback and pose landmarks were overlaid on video frames in real-time.

### Challenges Faced

#### 1. **Accuracy of Pose Detection:**
   - MediaPipe occasionally produced erroneous landmark detections under poor lighting conditions or with occluded joints. This required robust pre-processing and adaptive thresholding to improve landmark accuracy.

#### 2. **Dynamic Variations in Poses:**
   - Variability in yoga poses among practitioners led to challenges in defining standard angles. To address this, the system allowed for tolerance levels in angle comparisons.

#### 3. **Real-time Performance:**
   - Real-time angle calculations and feedback generation required optimization to minimize latency. Efficient memory management and leveraging GPU acceleration mitigated this issue.

#### 4. **Feedback Presentation:**
   - Displaying corrective feedback in a clear and concise manner was a challenge. A structured layout and color-coded messages were implemented to improve user comprehension.

#### 5. **Dataset Limitations:**
   - The dataset lacked diversity in poses, limiting the system’s ability to detect and correct advanced or uncommon yoga postures. Future work involves expanding the dataset to cover a broader range of poses.



Ai chatbot 

## Extension: AI-Based Chatbot Integration

### Overview

To enhance user interaction and support beyond pose detection, an **AI-powered chatbot** is integrated into the system. This chatbot leverages computer vision for **pose identification** and a natural language processing (NLP) backend to provide **contextual feedback, pose information, and answer user queries**.

### Workflow

1. **Image Upload & Pose Detection**

   * Users upload an image of their yoga pose.
   * The system processes the image using **MediaPipe + OpenCV** to extract landmarks and calculate joint angles.
   * The detected angles are matched against the dataset to classify the yoga pose.

2. **Pose Information Retrieval**

   * Once the pose is identified, the chatbot retrieves details such as:

     * **Pose Name (Sanskrit & English)**
     * **Targeted Muscles & Benefits**
     * **Contraindications & Safety Precautions**
     * **Step-by-step Instructions**

3. **User Query Handling**

   * Users can ask questions in natural language, such as:

     * “What are the benefits of *Warrior Pose*?”
     * “Can I practice this pose with knee pain?”
     * “How long should I hold this posture?”
   * The chatbot uses an **NLP model (e.g., GPT-based)** fine-tuned with yoga knowledge to provide accurate responses.

4. **Personalized Feedback**

   * Based on pose comparison with the dataset, the chatbot provides **correction suggestions** (e.g., “Straighten your spine” or “Move your shoulders back”).
   * Feedback is adaptive, considering the user’s uploaded pose angles and tolerance thresholds.

### Implementation Tools

* **Pose Detection:** MediaPipe, OpenCV
* **Data Handling:** NumPy, Pandas (for angle dataset)
* **Chatbot / NLP:** Transformers (Hugging Face), OpenAI API, or Rasa framework for conversational AI
* **Backend:** streamllit for handling uploads and queries
* **Frontend:** Streamlit / Tkinter / Web UI for user-friendly interaction

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of combining computer vision and artificial intelligence to assist yoga practitioners. The proposed system effectively detects yoga poses and provides real-time feedback for posture improvement, making it a valuable tool for self-guided practice. While challenges remain, particularly in improving accuracy and expanding pose diversity, the results highlight the feasibility of integrating technology into traditional disciplines like yoga. Future iterations of this system will focus on enhancing accuracy, supporting more complex poses, and implementing machine learning algorithms for adaptive feedback tailored to individual users.

The developed system not only promotes better yoga practices but also showcases the broader potential of AI-driven solutions in health and wellness domains.
